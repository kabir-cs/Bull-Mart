### Why the frontend directory has an arrow and is not visible in the GitHub app

The arrow icon on GitHub and the inability to see the `frontend` directory in your local file explorer or the GitHub Desktop app is because **`frontend` is a Git submodule**. Here‚Äôs what that means and how to resolve it:

---

#### What is a Git submodule?
- A submodule is a reference to another Git repository inside your main repository.
- On GitHub, submodules appear as a folder with an arrow and a commit hash, not as a regular directory.
- Locally, if you haven‚Äôt initialized the submodule, the folder will be empty or missing.

---

#### How to make the frontend directory appear locally

1. **Initialize and update submodules:**
   Open your terminal in the project root and run:
   ```sh
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
   This will download the actual contents of the `frontend` submodule.

2. **After running the command:**
   - The `frontend` directory will be populated with its files.
   - You‚Äôll be able to see and open it in your file explorer, code editor, and the GitHub Desktop app.

---

#### Why does GitHub show an arrow?
- The arrow indicates that the folder is a submodule, not a regular directory.
- You can click the folder on GitHub to see which repository and commit it points to, but you won‚Äôt see the files directly in the main repo‚Äôs file tree.
